### Like Pocket for Reddit saves.

## What Is Unearth?

### Background

Reddit is a goldmine of information—with posts and comments ranging in emotion
from funny and lighthearted, to straight-to-the-point and motivational, to
everything in-between and beyond. It's not uncommon for Redditors to save these
things, finding value in them and wishing to have a reference to it later on.

But saving things leads to a couple of problems. For starters, the number of
saves allowed on Reddit is limited and there is the chance of previous saves
being overwritten when that limit is reached. The other issue is many Redditors
save things but forget to ever go back and view said things. [Read more about why
Reddit's save functionality is subpar](https://cedric.tech/blog/reddits-save-functionality-sucks/).

### Vision

The current tools provided by Reddit are insufficient at helping Redditors
manage and rediscover their saved things.

**Unearth 2.0 aims to be the best platform to help Redditors manage their
saved content and regain control of their saved data.** In version 1.0, we
wanted to help Redditors rediscover the things they have saved through the use
of frequent reminders via email.

That service has [proven to be helpful for many](https://cedric.tech/blog/unearth-diary-04-does-it-even-work/)
but doesn't check as many of the boxes as we'd like. So, after further analysis
of the complaints Redditors had with saving things, we designed an app capable
of solving many of those other issues, namely: categorizing saves into folders
or with tags, filtering, searching, and sorting saves.

### Status

Unearth 2.0 is currently still in development.

Unearth 1.0 (Reddit saves surfacing service) however is completed.
[Feel free to try it today](https://www.tryunearth.com).

### Ground Rules

#### Reporting a bug or discussing a feature idea

If you found a technical bug on Unearth or have ideas for features we should
implement, the issue tracker is the best place to share your ideas. ([click here
to open a new issue](https://github.com/tryunearth/server/issues/new))

#### Fixing a bug or implementing a new feature

If you find a bug on Unearth and open a PR that fixes it we'll review it as soon
as possible.

If you want to implement a new feature, open an issue first to discuss what it'd
look like to ensure it fits in our roadmap.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

#### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

##### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

##### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

##### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
